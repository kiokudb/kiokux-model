=head1 NAME

KiokuX::Model - A simple application specific wrapper for L<KiokuDB>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# start with the base class:

	KiokuX::Model->new( dsn => "bdb:dir=/var/myapp/db" );



	# later you can add convenience methods by subclassing:

	package MyApp::DB;
	use Moose;

	extends qw(KiokuX::Model);

	sub add_user {
		my ( $self, @args ) = @_;

		my $user = MyApp::User->new(@args);

		$self->txn_do(sub {
			$self->insert($user);
		});

		return $user;
	}


	# Then just use it like this:

	MyApp::DB->new( dsn => "bdb:dir=/var/myapp/db" );

	# or automatically using e.g. L<Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB>:

	$c->model("kiokudb");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This base class makes it easy to create L<KiokuDB> database instances in your
application. It provides a standard way to instantiate and use a L<KiokuDB>
object in your apps.

As your app grows you can subclass it and provide additional convenience
methods, without changing the structure of the code, but simply swapping your
subclass for L<KiokuX::Model> in e.g. L<Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB> or whatever
you use to glue it in.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item directory

The instantiated directory.

Created using the other attributes at C<BUILD> time.

This attribute has delegations set up for all the methods of the L<KiokuDB>
class.

=item dsn

e.g. C<bdb:dir=root/db>. See L<KiokuDB/connect>.

=item extra_args

Additional arguments to pass to C<connect>.

Can be a hash reference or an array reference.

=item typemap

An optional custom typemap to add. See L<KiokuDB::Typemap> and
L<KiokuDB/typemap>.
